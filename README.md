PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
Logistics involve the integration of inventory, warehousing, material handling, packing and transportation of products with security.
The fact that all the pharmaceuticals products and supplies are manufactured outside Chile, make imperative the optimal atenction to Goblal systems of supplier relationship and the expantion of supply chain over bounderies of India and China. Former and actual supplier was in U.S; Europe; Colombia and Brazil

LOGISTICS
Logistcs is the branch relating in procuring, maintainin and transporting material, personal and facilities.
Logistics involves the inegration of information, transportation, inventory, wharehousing, material handling with 
adecuate security.Is that part of the supply chain wiich plans, implements and control the efficient, effective 
forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, service and related information between the point of consumption in
in order to meet customer and legal requierements.

IMPORTANCE OF LOGISTIC FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
Importants point are the Inventory reduction and improvment in order cicle time.
The most important point are quqlity consistency throughout the lifetimi of the products. The distribution environment
canvary greatly, especialy when the pruducts go from India to Santiago, Chile by example,
Seasonal changes must to be considerent in the logistics of a pharmaceutical product.
The inventory anagement has change from "Inventory Push" to "Just in Time", All that produce a increment in information 
in and out of the organization.
THE SUPPLY CHAIN
The pharmaceutical manufacturinag supply chain involves two main stages. the first is the production of active ingredients(APIs).
These are the key part of a drug,  witch produce an effect. Such production is chemical-intensive involving reactors for drug auabstance
manufacture. The second is a phisical process know as formulation prodcution. Substance known as excipients are mixed with APIs to turn 
a drug into a consumable form, such as tablet, liquid, capsule, cream, ointment or inyectable product.
For nmore than a dacade now. China has been the largest manufacure of APIs in the world. Aound 40% of Mundial production is in China.
Before US, Europe an Japan use to mnaufacure 90% of APIs, no eny more.
India play a prominet role in the formulation segment of the industry. India is the third largest producers of pharmaceuticals in the
world by volume.
India department of Pharmaceuticals reported that it supply 20% of "generics" drugs. This are drug that are nol longer under patent 
and are open to any company to produce are sell, and are priced below Brand names.
Chile import 30% of its Pharmaceuticals from India and a biggest porcentage of APIs from China.
India is the "Pharmacy of the world" for reazons of the range and volume of pharmaceuticals it is able toproduce as well of the low prices
is able to offer. Indian pharmaceuticals companies are the largest among Asian countries in ther capacuty to produce consumable products.
India, howevwr lags a bit in developing new pharmaceuticals drugs. 
Active Pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are raw material in productios of formulations. China was one of the leading countries to produce
and sell APIs to the rest of the world until recently.
COVID_!)
The outbreak of Pandemic of Covid-19 and its origen in China, the prodcution of APIs was stopped in great measure. This must affect prices
to wich Beijing exports this ingridcnets.
The impact is grave, as most of this APLs are produced in Hubei province.
India import around 90% of APLIs that use from China
That has damaged the Pharmaceutical Chain Supply.
In the future India will began to produce APLs.
At the moment in very hard to proyect the end of the pandemic, to proyect when Chine will began exporting in regular form, when India will do the same.
In any way in all probability the Pharmaceutical Chain Supply that came from Asia will have other extructure and we must to consider from which companies
will be are principal suppliers.
